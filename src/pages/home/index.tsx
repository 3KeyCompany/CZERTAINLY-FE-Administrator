        <p>The only tool you need for your certificate management.</p>
        <p>
          CZERTAINLY acts as integration component for certification
          authorities which has the following goals:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            provide a higher level abstraction on top of certification authority
            configuration
          </li>
          <li>
            introduce agility â€“ change the service configuration on the fly,
            without impact on integrated clients
          </li>
          <li>
            streamline integration procedure and reduce time and costs needed
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The CZERTAINLY is sitting usually in front of the RA, or can be the
          part of it, or can communicate directly with the CA. Based on the
          definition of profiles and configured authorisation of clients, CZERTAINLY
          will handle the communication with the CA accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the CZERTAINLY, you can manage the integration with the CA
          and definition of the profiles, which clients are authorised to which
          profiles, and allow different administrators to take care of the
          solution, including management of different roles and access rules.
